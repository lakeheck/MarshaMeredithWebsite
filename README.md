# Marsha Meredith Experience

An interactive, web-based ink simulation using real-time weather data to generate ink colors. 

## Usage 
1. Define palettes in `assets/palettes.json`
    - Each palette should have 5 colors, and each color should have r,g,b,a values 
2. Update palette programatically by changing config.PALETTE and config.SUB_PALETTE (e.g. based on weather API data, update those values, the visual will update automatically)
    - There are some GUI sliders hooked up in the demo version for easy exploration
3. `main.js` is the current entry point and could be replaced by whatever integration method makes sense for the project
